# hogg

Hogg is an HTTP reverse proxy.

It might also do websocket-proxying, load-balancing, rate-limiting,
service-discovery, authentication, authorization, caching, service
aggregation, and any other cool stuff I can think of.

But for now, it doesn't do any of those things, because I'm still
building it.
